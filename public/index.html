  <h2>My Life</h2>
  <P>I am married to a wonderful man I met in church in the mid 90s.  We have been married for almost 14 years.  I am a lucky woman!</p>
  
  <h2>My Dog</h2>
  <p>My dog Bonnie is the sweetest thing.  She is a mixed breed and some day I am going to get her dna profiled so I can find out what she is.</p>

  <h2>My Cats</h2>
  <p>I have four cats.  Three of them are geriatric, one of them is about 4 years old.  The youngest one is really mean and surly.</p>

  <h2>Location</h2>
  <p>I live in the northwest United States</p>
  <p>That is all</p>
